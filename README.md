This project was originally part of a volunteer weekend program called GiveCamp which takes place here in Cleveland every year. The goal of the event is to bring technologists and non-profit organizations together to solve a technical problem for the non-profit. 

##The Project
The goal of the project was to develop a simple way of tracking volunteer hours, allowing volunteers to "clock in" and "clock out" while they worked at the bicycle co-op. With each hour a volunteer worked at the co-op, they would earn credits which could then be spent at the co-op on bicycle parts and use of the repair facilities. It would streamline the currently more complicated process that existed on a really old version of Drupal. The other goals of the project were to allow the administrators at the co-op to see how many hours a volunteer had, to input "purchases" using that volunteers' credits, and to clock volunteers out that had forgotten to do so. 

After the event ended, I stayed in touch with the primary stakeholder and over the next several months, I developed a .NET based version of the solution that he was looking for. This is based on custom ASP.NET MVC using C# and a custom developed SQL Server database.
